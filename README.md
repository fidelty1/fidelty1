### Astabiler Multivibrator

- *Tech Stack:*

![Autodesk EAGLE](https://img.shields.io/badge/Autodesk_EAGLE-32CD32.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=autodesk&logoColor=white)

#### Description

The astable multivibrator is an oscillator circuit based on two transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors, generating a square wave signal. The PCB fabrication process involved printing the photomask on transparent film, UV exposure to harden the traces, etching copper with ferric chloride, and drilling holes for components. Then, soldering of the transistors, diodes, and other components was completed, followed by testing to ensure the circuit's proper operation.

#### Description

I designed an alarm clock project in EasyEDA, based on the ATmega328P microprocessor. The design includes a coin cell battery, temperature sensor, RTC clock module, buzzer, and a display that alternates between showing the time and temperature, controlled by a button. The time for the alarm can be set on the RTC, which is backed by a battery to retain settings during power loss. The microcontroller handles the logic for displaying time, reading the temperature sensor, and managing the alarm function. The software for this project was written in C++ using the Arduino IDE, ensuring easy integration with the hardware components.

#### Description

The project involved designing a two-layer PCB in EasyEDA to integrate measurement systems for heart rate, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), and ECG. The MAX30101 and MAX86150 analog front-end chips were used for photoplethysmography (PPG) and ECG measurements, communicating with the microcontroller via I2C. The PCB design focused on optimizing the layout and trace routing to minimize noise and ensure correct system operation.

Custom libraries were developed in C for the STM32 microcontroller to handle heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and SpO2 calculations. The results, including data and signal waveforms, are displayed on an LCD screen via an SPI interface. The PCB was tested under various conditions to ensure stability and measurement accuracy. The system provides real-time monitoring of vital signs and visualizes the data along with corresponding waveforms.

#### Description
The microprocessor system design was implemented as a four-layer printed circuit board in the Altium Designer environment. The control unit of the project is an ultra-low-power microprocessor STM32L552CEU6 (QFN-48 package).

In addition to the standard hardware setup for microprocessor configuration (BOOT0, VMCU, RST), the microprocessor system is also integrated with sensors such as the ADXL343 accelerometer, the MCP9800 digital temperature sensor, and the MAX30205 biomedical human body temperature sensor. The latter includes an interrupt pin (configured for 37-39°C), which is set to wake up the microprocessor via low-power wake-up pins.

The system also features a configured buzzer, in which melodies such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Happy Birthday have been implemented.

#### Abstract
The article presents applications of STM32 microcontrollers for real-time biomedical signal processing, with particular emphasis on the use of CMSIS-DSP libraries. The basics of photoplethysmographic (PPG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signal processing are discussed, the structure of the CMSIS-DSP library and the concept of signal processing in microcontrollers are presented and an example implementation of DSP algorithms is provided. Computational algorithm optimization elements are also presented, focusing on efficient memory and processor resource management. The proposed solutions can be applied in wearable electronics systems for monitoring human life parameters, such as blood oxygen saturation measurement and heart rate variability calculations.
